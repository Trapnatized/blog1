***Shout out to F11snipe for figuring this out first using curl, I just took this IDOR a little further*** 😉️.

During a live stream F11 mentioned he knew a way to turn in flags after a game was over but was not going to reveal how it was done. Knowing that this was possible I decided to try to figure out how to do this myself. I ended up using Burp Suite to test this out.
