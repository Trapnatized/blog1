<p>Apple trees are cultivated worldwide, and are the most widely grown
species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where
its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have
been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe, and were brought
to North America by European colonists.</p>]]></content><author><name>trap</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[An apple is a sweet, edible fruit produced by an apple tree.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Bananas</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2023/05/11/bananas.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bananas" /><published>2023-05-11T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-05-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2023/05/11/bananas</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2023/05/11/bananas.html"><![CDATA[<p>A banana is an edible fruit ‚Äì botanically a berry ‚Äì produced by several

<p>In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called ‚Äúplantains‚Äù,
distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size,
color, and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft
flesh rich in starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow,
red, purple, or brown when ripe.</p>]]></content><author><name>trap</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A banana is an edible fruit ‚Äì botanically a berry ‚Äì produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Kiwi</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2023/05/11/kiwi.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Kiwi" /><published>2023-05-11T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-05-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2023/05/11/kiwi</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2023/05/11/kiwi.html"><![CDATA[<p>Kiwifruit (often abbreviated as kiwi), or Chinese gooseberry is the

(1.8‚Äì2.2 in) in diameter). It has a fibrous, dull greenish-brown skin

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>
